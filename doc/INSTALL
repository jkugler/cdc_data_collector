To use the 'ow' sensors you must download, compile, and install the OWFS
project here: http://owfs.org/index.php?page=download Be sure to enable
the python module.

Your distribution may also have a package for the owfs suite, but at
the time of this writing, there were not many (if any) distributions
that did.

Run

python setup.py install

Installation requires setuptools.

DISCLAIMER
==========
This is an gamma release.  There are 62 tests which cover 95%+ of the code,
but not much documentation.  The interface (especially of
cchrc.Sensor.SensorBase can be considered relatively stable).

This project is in use in a real-world situation, so has all known bugs
worked out.  But if you find one, please let me know!

DISCLAIMER
==========
This is a 1.0 release.  There are 62 tests which cover 95%+ of the code,
but not much documentation.  The interface (especially of
cchrc.Sensor.SensorBase) can be considered stable. Any API breakage
will be confined to major versions (i.e. 1.0 -> 2.0).

This project is in use in a real-world situation, so has all known bugs
worked out.  But if you find one, please let us know!
